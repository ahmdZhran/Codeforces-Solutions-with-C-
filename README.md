# codeforces-with-c-
This repository contains my solutions to problems on Codeforces written in C++.
How to Use
You can access the solutions for each problem by navigating to the corresponding folder named after the problem code.
Each folder contains the source code (*.cpp) for the solution and an input file (*.in) with test cases used to verify the correctness of the solution. 
You can also find the link to the problem statement in the README.md file in each folder.
#Disclaimer
These solutions are solely intended for educational purposes,
and should not be used for cheating in any way on Codeforces or any other competitive programming website.

I hope this README file helps you in presenting your Codeforces solutions in a clear and organized manner. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
